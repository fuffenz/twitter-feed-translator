Twitter Feed Translator is a basic WordPress plugin that is meant to be used together with the plugin Twitter Widget Pro.

Twitter Feed Translator will use Microsoft's Translation API and translate all tweets displayed by Twitter Widget Pro.

To minimize API calls, translations are cached.  This means that you can probably use the free version of the Translation API, unless you have a very active Twitter feed (or many visitors...).

No guarantees.
